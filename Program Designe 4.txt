4. Create a basic application 

How much water runs off a roof in a rain storm?

To calculate the runoff from any given rainfall: Take the dimensions of the 
footprint of the roof and convert them to inches. (So, a 50' x 20' roof is 600" x 240").
Multiply the roof dimensions by the number of inches of rainfall. 
In this example, 600" x 240" x 1" = 144,000 cubic inches of water. 
Divide that result by 231 to get the number of gallons (because 1 gallon = 231 cubic inches). (144,000/231 = 623.38).

Write the pseudocode for the above problem. 
If you use the numbers provided in the example then the correct pseudocode will calculate the same result.

A) Define the problem by constructing an algorithm usig pseudocode
Algorithm: (12x, 12x)(x)
Pseudocode:
1. Roof dimensions in inches (x, x)*12
2. Multipy the dimensions of the footprint of teh roof in inches by the number of inches of rainfall(12x,12x)* #of inches of rainfall
3. Output reults 
b)Create an IPO diagram showing input, ouput, and processing steps 
Input: Dimensions of the footprint of the roof in feet
Proccess: Multipy dimmention of the footprint of the roof in feet by 12 to convert into inche and multipy by the number of inches of rainfall : (12x, 12x)(x)
Output: Print reult 

C)what control strucutes (sequence, selection, and repetition) are required?
sequence
D) What variables are required?
input variables: Roof di
output variable: reults
E) show a chek of your solution with test data for at least two valid test cases.
