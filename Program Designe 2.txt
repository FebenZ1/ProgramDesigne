Program Designe 

2. Create a basic application 

His little sister now wants a program to read three numbers, 
add them together and print their total.

A) Define the problem by constructing an algorithm usig pseudocode
Algorithm: result = X+X+X
Pseudocode:
1.Generate RandomNumbers X*3
2.Apply algorithm X+X+X
3.Output Results sum of x

b)Create an IPO diagram showing input, ouput, and processing steps 
Input: RandomNumber 
Proccess: Add RandomNumber X+X+X
Output: Result

C)what control strucutes (sequence, selection, and repetition) are required?

Sequenc 

D) What variables are required?
Variables: RandomNumber
Output variables: Result

E) Show a chek of your solution with test data for at least two valid test cases.

Result = 3+3+3=9
Result = 5+5+5=15
