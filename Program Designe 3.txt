3. Create a basic application 

A program is needed to prompt the user operator for ten exam scores, calculate the average 
score and display the result to the screen. The average score is calculated as the sum of
the scores divided by the number of scores.

A) Define the problem by constructing an algorithm usig pseudocode

Algorithm: result= (X+X+X+X+X+X+X+X+X+X)/10
Pseudocode:
1.Prompt user for ExamScores x10
2.Sum of ExamScores(X+X+X+X+X+X+X+X+X+X) 
3.Divide sum ExamScores by 10
4.Display results
 
B)Create an IPO diagram showing input, ouput, and processing steps 
Input:ExamScores
Proccess: sum of ExamScores divided by 10
Output: Results 

C)what control strucutes (sequence, selection, and repetition) are required?

sequence and repetition 

D) What variables are required?

Input variable: ExamScores
Output variables: Results

E) show a chek of your solution with test data for at least two valid test cases.

Result=(90+90+90+90+90+90+90+80+90+90)/10=90

Result= (90+90+90+90+90+90+90+80+90+100)/10=91
